## Switch
A `switch` statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of `if - else` statements. It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

Go's switch is like the other languages, except that:
1. Go only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow. Saying that we don't need the `break` statement;
2. Go cases don't need to be constants;
3. The involved values don't need to be integers.
