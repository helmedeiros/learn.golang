# Learning Path: Go

So what are some popular options if you want to learn a new programming language?
- Learn from an online tutorial or
- Learn from an online course

Some may argue that the best way of learning a new language is:
- To learn syntax of the new programming language, then
- Build a personal project using that language

To achieve good code skills, is very important to be surrounded by other developers. Find a mentor, read lost of code and get your code reviewed.  

Saying that, below you will find not only a list of contents, but also projects to contribute and people to follow. This is my `Golang` learning path.

## Project to contribute:
1. [Go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github)
2. [CodeMontage](http://codemontage.com/): Give forward by contributing to open source, social good projects that benefit organizations making a difference in the world.
3. [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/): Give back to open source, one issue at a time, with CodeTriage. You’ll get one issue from your favorite repo per day to help you dig deeper, learn more, and stay involved with the code you rely on.
4. [issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/): Contribute to Open Source. Search issue labels to find the right project for you!
5. [Pull Request Roulette](http://www.pullrequestroulette.com/): Find open source pull requests that need a reviewer before merging.

## Last words:
Further, once an engineer has a working knowledge of Effective Go, there seems to be very little friction in moving from “how the application behaves today” to “how the application should behave in the ideal case.”

1. Should a slow response from this backend abort the entire request?
2. Should we retry exactly once, and then serve partial results?
3. This agent has been acting strangely: can we install a 250ms timeout?


Every high-level scenario in the behavior of a system can be expressed in a straightforward and idiomatic implementation, without the need for libraries or frameworks. Removing layers of abstraction reduces complexity; plainly stated, simpler code is better code.
